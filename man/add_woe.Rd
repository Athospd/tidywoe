\title{Add WoE in a data.frame}
\usage{
add_woe(.data, .response, ..., .woe_dictionary = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A tbl. The data.frame to plug the new woe version columns.}

\item{.response}{unquoted name of the response variable.}

\item{...}{unquoted names of explanatory variables, passed as you would pass variables to \code{dplyr::select()}. This means that you can use all the helpers like \code{starts_with()} and \code{matches()}.}

\item{.woe_dictionary}{a tbl. If NULL the function will build a dictionary for those variables passed to \code{...}. You can pass a custom dictionary too, see \code{\link{woe_dictionary()}} for details.}
}
\value{
a tibble with the original columns of .data plus the woe columns wanted.
}
\description{
A tidyverse friendly way to plug WoE versions of a set of explanatory variables against a given dicotomous response.
}
\details{
You can pass a custom dictionary to \code{add_woe()}. It must have the exactly the same structure of the output of \code{woe_dictionary()}. One easy way to do this is to tweak a output returned from it.
